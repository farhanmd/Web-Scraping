  Anchorage, Alaska.  My wife, Leslie and I are spearheading a fund to
  help our very wonderful close friends, Louie and Kimmie Shaw of
  Chugiak also. Louie is enroute by air medivac  today from Anchorage to
  Califorina to be entered into Cedars Sinai Hospital heart recipient

  has lived life to its fullest pursuing all the passions of family,
  friends, hunting ,fishing and work on the North Slope oil fields with

  the better. Simple tasks became laborsome with shortness of breath,
  fatigue and a host of related heart failure symptoms. He did not
  return to work in May as he felt unable to do his job there. His
  Cardiology team confirmed his heart was failing substantially. The
  Doctors at Heart Institute began the proccess to enroll him for heart
  reciepent program at Cedars Sinai. Saturday June 30th, Louie is on his
  way by air medivac to that hospital to enter thier program. We know that this is the best path for his survival in this

  premier facilities in the nation for this procedure. Louie is going
  there to wait for the gift of life. He has a great health insurance
  program that will meet most of his medical financial needs. Kimmie,

"1,020",Please Help Geni Pay Her Medical Bills,,"Aug 1, 2018",,,"Geni was excited to be a new mom to her little sweet boy born a few
  weeks premature, but healthy! Within a few days, Geni was having some
  unusual issues and returned to her doctor. She was resting and doing
  all the things the Dr told her to do, but she kept feeling worse. So
  she decided to get another opinion and see another Dr, who had a few concerns. After 3 1/2 weeks post-baby, tests showed her liver was enlarged and
  excess fluid was in her abdomen requiring a hospital stay to determine
  the cause. More tests, and the determination to send Geni by ambulance
  to Salt Lake City to see specialists and more intense testing. Dr's in
  Salt Lake conferred with a specialist at Stanford U Hospital, and it
  was determined she had all the markers of budd-chiari , a very rare disorder that causes blood clots and
  liver damage. Geni was put on blood thinners hoping to break the clots
  that way, but had to have a procedure through her neck and groin with
  medication shot directly onto the clots to break it up, These
  procedures were hard on Geni, and took hours in the OR. Geni has been
  in the hospital over 2 weeks dealing with recovery. She has been
  unable to work, and will require more time to recover at home. Her
  family and boyfriend have been with her through most of this time

"2,080",Please help Maria beat Syringomyelia,Canadian Dollar,"Aug 9, 2018",of $10k goal,25,"My family and I have made this campaign in the hopes of not
    only receiving support but to also gain awareness for a supposedly
    ""rare"" disease. Since I was diagnosed, I have gotten in
    touch with patients from all over the world who have the same
    condition, and most people are misdiagnosed, or their symptoms are
    disregarded for years (as was my case). Creating awareness is so
    important to help others recognize signs and get proper treatment in
    time. Thank you for checking out my campaign, and I would be so
    grateful for your contribution! Have you ever heard of Arnold Chiari Syndrome and
    Syringomyelia? Probably not; I had no idea what it was until I was diagnosed in 2016! In my best efforts to sum it up, I have a malformation in the base of
  my skull that compresses my cerebellum and medulla. As a result,
  cerebral fluid is trapped inside my spinal cord, which is slowly
  killing off nerves that are vital for my organs and extremities to
  function properly. What are the symptoms and repercussions? The most severe outcome is tetraplegia. There are many symptoms, but
  some are chronic neck and back pain, loss of muscle strength, vertigo,
  migraines, partial or total paralysis of my arms, legs and torso. At
  the moment, I have already lost sensitivity to heat or cold (I can
  burn myself easily), am losing reflexes in my arms and legs, motor
  control and strength, and I live in constant neck and back pain, let
  alone face annoying headaches. Surgery needs to be done as soon as
  possible to prevent my symptoms from getting worse before it is too late. Is there a cure or treatment? Apparently, there is no cure. However, its progression can be
  controlled or even reversed through a surgery that consists of cutting
  the Filum Terminale - a ligament that connects the spinal cord and spine. The CHIARI Institute located in Barcelona is the pioneer of this
  minimally invasive surgical procedure. I went to Spain in May with my
  parents for a consultation, and fortunately, their surgical team
  confirmed that I am a candidate for treatment! The cost of the surgery
  abroad is very expensive (approx $44,000), however, I have been lucky
  enough to find a neurosurgeon in Brazil who is offering the same
  treatment. Unfortunately, this surgery is not offered in Canada. The second and most common treatment in attempts to control the
  disease is decompressive craniectomy brain surgery. I faced this
  high-risk and extremely painful surgery in 2016, but unfortunately, my
  symptoms have continued to progress. For more information on Chiari and Syringomyelia and its treatment,

320,Help Lauren get something off their chest!,U.S. Dollar,,of $12k goal,8,"About me: I’m a passionate animal lover from Roanoke,
  VA working at a nonprofit animal welfare organization in the
  Shenandoah Valley (yep, the same one the sad song is about). I was
  privileged as a young adult to spend time in safe spaces, and I found
  the latitude to question my gender. While I was described as a tomboy
  in my childhood, there is perhaps more to the story as an adult. The Challenge: I am deeply rooted to nonprofits and
  cause-based work, leaving little time and energy left towards pure
  capital gain. That said, over my years of questioning, researching,
  listening to trans people’s personal journeys, and amplifying voices
  where and when I can, surgery is going to be part of my transition to
  greater comfort in my own body and my own skin. While I find it
  difficult to put into language the nuance of how I feel in my body,
  the long and short of it is that I’m very uncomfortable with some of
  its features that cannot be the shape I feel they should without top surgery. The Goal: The purpose of this fundraiser is to raise
  money to pay for my top surgery. Donations will go directly to getting
  something off my chest so I can continue my work in the nonprofit
  sector with animals who have no voice otherwise. I humbly ask for your consideration among
  so many other worthy causes. A few dollars, a few cents, is deeply
  appreciated! Every contribution counts! No donation is too small!",https://fundrazr.com/boobsbegone

  tumours to grow anywhere in my brain, along with the spinal cords and
  peripheral nerves. So far I have had 20 different surgeries to safely
  remove the tumours whenever needed to preserve my life. In the end of 2017, I need to undergo surgery again to remove
  multiple large tumours called schwannoma from both my arms. They have
  made my fingers and hands increasingly numb. If they are not carefully
  removed, they can paralyze my arms. I cannot become incapacitated, my mother will be helpless if I lose
  the ability to take care of myself. Last year, I had brain surgery at
  the US NIH, the surgery was done well. However, I was not taken cared

  to adapt by getting help from people to do my work and in order to
  stay productive, while my mother started having to prepare my daily

"6,032",Ride to Give - An Adaptive Bike for Rosalee,U.S. Dollar,,of $5.8k goal,151,"4 and 1/2 years ago, Jessica and Aaron Truelove were
  excitedly awaiting the birth of their first child.  Jessica's
  pregnancy had seemed typical, but Rosalee was born at 28 weeks
  weighing 1lb 15oz. The night she was born, Rosalee had a pulmonary hemorrhage causing
    her fight for life to become even more difficult. For a tiny baby like Rosalee, the chances of her surviving
    prematurity AND the pulmonary hemorrhage were slim. Rosalee ended up spending 73 days in the NICU. At her discharge cranial ultrasound
      on day 69, Jessica and Aaron were told that Rosalee had suffered
      from a brain injury called Periventricular
  Leukomalacia. Her doctors were not sure when this injury
  occurred, but it was sometime between birth and day
  69. Periventricular Leukomalacia (PVL) is characterized by the death
  of the white matter of the brain due to  lack of oxygen or blood flow
  to the periventricular area of the brain. Babies with PVL are at risk
  for motor disorders, delayed mental development, coordination
  problems, and vision and hearing impairments. PVL may be accompanied
  by a hemorrhage or bleeding in the periventricular-intraventricular
  area (the area around and inside the ventricles) and can lead to
  cerebral palsy. The disorder is diagnosed by ultrasound of the head,
  as was what the case with Rosalee. Since knowing about her injury early on, Rosalee's doctors were able
  to prescribe interventions which were key to giving Rosalee the best
  possible outcome. As soon as Rosalee was discharged from the NICU, she
  began in-home therapy sessions while she grew stronger and less at
  risk for common germs. During these early months, the hardest part
  with Rosalee's initial diagnosis of PVL was the waiting game. The
  Trueloves became consumed with what Rosalee was or wasn't doing on
  time, basically putting her under a developmental microscope. When Rosalee was around 6-8 months, it became apparent that she
    was becoming increasingly delayed in her fine and gross motor
    skills, but it was not until she was 18 months that the Trueloves
    received the official diagnosis of Spastic Diplegia Cerebral Palsy . Jessica and Aaron continue to work with Rosalee daily to help improve
  her mobility and build her strength. Rosalee receives multiple
  therapies weekly, and as far as her prognosis, her neurologist and
  developmental specialist feel like she will eventually be able to walk
  with assistance for a short distance, but will spend her life
  primarily in a wheelchair. In September, Rosalee will become a big
  sister and the Trueloves are working extra hard this summer to keep
  her on track. One of the things that Rosalee's therapists suggested to help
  strengthen her core and build independence is an adaptive bicycle,
  like the ones sold by www.freedomconcepts.com . Cycling
  would offer her greater independence, a creative way to increase her
  mobility, and most importantly a way to connect with her parents
  through outdoor exercise. The staff at Freedom Concepts have
    visited with Rosalee and found the perfect size bike for
  her use now and to grow with her for years to come. Unfortunately, the
  Trueloves' insurance will not cover the cost so Freedom Concepts
  suggested they reach out to Ride to Give. Ride to Give is excited to offer the Truloves support in
    purchasing an adaptive bicycle for Rosalee.  We have seen time and
    again how alternative therapies, like cycling, can make a
    significant impact on medically complex children like Rosalee.
    Please help us purchase Rosalee a Freedom Concepts Bicycle so she
    can enjoy a life of inclusion rather than one of exclusion. At this time, Rosalee does not have a Facebook Page of her own,
      so follow Ride to Give on Facebook for all updates. Contributions are solicited with the understanding that the
      donee organization (Ride to Give, 501c3 tax ID 46-2952297) has

"33,310",Help Victor Beat MS with Stem Cell Transplantation,Canadian Dollar,"Jul 21, 2018",of $40k goal,168,"Hello, We are a group of Victor's family and friends and we are trying to
  help him raise funds to finance a trip overseas, to attend a medical
  centre that specializes in Stem Cell Treatments. The exact centre and
  the exact treatment are yet to be determined.This will depend on the
  amount of funds raised. There are many variables involved in this type
  of treatment, each with their own respective cost. An example would
  be, an Autologous  transplant (collecting a patient's own
  blood-forming stem cells), versus an Allogeneic transplant (collecting
  stem cells from a matching donor). Fortunately, it's a very hopeful
  time for people suffering from Multiple Sclerosis and other
  Auto-Immune diseases. There have been many success stories (some of
  which you can view on YouTube). This type of treatment is becoming
  mainstream in many countries around the world. Sadly for Victor,
  Canada is still in its developmental stage. Please take a moment and read a little bit about Victor's life and
  his battle with MS. If you can financially manage a small donation, it
  would be truly appreciated. A donation can be made right from this
  page. Victor will receive 95% of the funds, and this wonderful website
  will receive 5%. Whether you can donate or not, please be so kind as
  to pass this page along, via email or social media, to as many people
  as you can.  We thank you and are grateful for your support. Most of you visiting this fundraising page already know Victor, but
  for those of you who don't please let me introduce him. Victor is 59
  years old and has been fighting an uphill battle with Multiple
  Sclerosis for 26 years. It has been quite a battle but he has always
  fought with courage and grace.  Victor first felt the symptoms of MS
  shortly after completing his first and only triathlon.  Soon after
  that race, he was eager to begin training in hopes of improving upon
  his time in the next race. It was then that the symptoms hit him, and
  they had an immediate and devastating effect.  He went from running 17
  miles a day to not being able to run one block. In 1984, just after completing college, Victor found employment with
  the CIBC in the Savings Application Department as a Programmer. Two
  years later he transferred to Host Facilities as a Programmer.  His
  talents were recognized  and he was promoted to manage a group of 7
  programmers. His team was the infrastructure and the bank's
  applications ran on their software. Victor was prepared to leave the bank due to his MS in 1999 when the
  logistics of getting to work became difficult, but in the year 2000,
  (potential Y2K crisis) he stayed on to ensure all applications ran
  smoothly. Victor left his managerial position shortly after this
  period and is now supported, in part, by longterm disability benefits. In 2010, Victor, his wife Michelle and his brother Tony, all went to
  Egypt to have the CCSVI (Chronic Cerebrospinal Venous Insufficiency) -
  Liberation treatment.  As you can imagine it was a quite an expensive
  endeavor. The physical benefits Victor experienced were remarkable but
  some affects were short lived. At that point, in 2010, Victor hadn't
  been able to move his right leg for many years. Amazingly, just a few
  hours after doctors placed catheters and balloon inflation into his
  collapsed and blocked veins, Victor was able to raise that same leg
  into the air.  When he returned home we could all see improvement and
  thought he was on his way to recovery.  Even his horrific Trigeminal
  Neuralgia pain was greatly reduced. Trigeminal Neuralgia
    is considered to be one of the most painful afflictions known.
    It is characterized by episodes of excruciating stabbing or
    electrical shock-like pains which hit one side of the face. The
    episodes of pain usually last up to two minutes and may occur
    spontaneously or be triggered by light stimulation. Victor has
    endured this affliction daily for over a decade. The CCSVI results lasted for approximately one year.  We believe the
  vein in his neck collapsed and became blocked once more. Due to the
  delicate nature of veins (as opposed to arteries), stents cannot be
  used. There is a risk of the stent becoming dislodged, migrating along
  the blood vessels and becoming lodged in the heart or lungs. Prior to the MS, Victor lived a very healthy lifestyle and continues
  to do so today. Beginning day one, Victor has not benefitted with any
  traditional medicine for his symptoms. In fact all prescribed options
  to manage pain only exacerbated his leg weakness. Research has since
  determined that as varied as MS symptoms may present so too are the
  outcomes with medication for Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis.
  To support his wellness, Victor employs various holistic forms. Some
  of the modalities include: Hyperbaric Oxygen treatments; Live Blood
  Cell Analysis; Reichian therapy; Homeopathy; Naturopathic Medicine; as
  well as following a strict diet and supplement regime. The financial
  impact has been staggering, but Victor attributes his longevity to
  these natural treatments. The driving force that gives Victor strength to endure this battle is
  his love for his family; his wife Michelle, daughter Simone, and son
  Kristian. He once stated to me that if he were able to go back in
  time, he would gladly suffer MS again if it meant he could spend his
  life with Michelle, and participate fully with their children while
  they strive to achieve their own personal and professional
  aspirations.  Victor is proud that both Simone and Kristian are
  excelling in university with a shared goal to positively impact
  healthcare for others. In the bottom left-hand corner of the above profile photo, there is a

"1,669",Steve Roberts: Cancer Treatment Appeal,Pound Sterling,"Aug 7, 2018",of £7.5k goal,41,"My dear friend Steve Roberts has just been diagnosed with cancer in
  his prostate. I'm fundraising to help him and his wife Susanna afford
  the inpatient treatment he's been offered at the end of July at the
  Camphill Wellbeing Trust Medical Centre in Aberdeen and its follow-up
  maintenance programme. This intensive protocol is widely used in
  Europe and will double his chances of a good recovery by boosting his
  immune system as well as targeting the cancer cells. Donations of any
  size are vitally needed and will be much appreciated. Thank you! In most men, prostate cancer is slow growing and merely kept under
  observation but Steve's has an aggressive element that needs treatment
  to stop it spreading. The Gleason Score grades prostate cancers on a
  scale of 2-10 and his MRI and recent biopsy results reveal a Grade 7
  tumour. It is currently localised and Stage 2. As his beloved wife
  Susanna lost both her father and her mother to cancer they're
  determined to maximise Steve's chances by using conventional and complementary medicine this time. The intensive Mistletoe protocol at CWT Aberdeen is a holistic,
  plant-based, whole-person approach which, in our opinion and according
  to research and scientific evidence, strengthens the immune system and
  the life force while directly tackling the tumour. We believe it will
  give him the best chance of surviving this disease and retaining a
  good quality of life. When I met with Steve and Susanna last Summer at Emerson College,
  Forest Row (below) we were pleased to find each other looking so well. Steve had only just
  retired the previous December. His five-decade long working life was
  split equally between the written word (as a journalist, book &
  magazine publisher, editor and book seller) and curative education
  (first as a Carer and House Father in residential homes at Hohepa, New
  Zealand and Bristol, then as a teacher, Letter Press  tutor,
  Administrator and Trustee in special needs education). He and I met
  when we worked together in staff development for Ruskin Mill Trust at
  their Freeman College site in Sheffield, but he seems twice as busy in retirement. Steve is now on the verge of completing his first book - about
  Creativity and the Writer's Muse - with a second one planned (on
  William Golding and the double) while simultaneously organising an
  international conference on Nature Spirits, Elemental Beings and
    Human Cooperation scheduled for May 2019, and giving public
  talks and workshops on a variety of subjects. You will probably remember this fizzy
    combination of positivity, energy, enthusiasm and wide-ranging
    curiosity from your own dealings with him! Please help me to help this husband, brother, stepfather,
    larger-than-life Kiwi and inspiring friend to very many people
    around the world get on with the job of living his life to the full
    while trying to improve it for others. Every single penny donated will be spent
  on Steve's inpatient treatment in July, his ongoing home injection
  maintenance programme and his recovery. Your positive thoughts, prayers and messages of support are
      equally valuable. Steve's email is steveroberts1151@gmail.com . He is currently feeling fine and is his
  usual cheerful self. Thank you very much. With every good wish, Alan Miggin",https://fundrazr.com/SteveRobertsAppeal

962,Help get Kris back on her feet.,U.S. Dollar,,of $2k goal,15,"On May 15th, 2017 I was in an ATV accident resulting in a surgery to
  place a plate and screws into my leg. On July 1st a severe bone
  infection was discovered and treatment with IV antibiotics began. I
  was then transported from a hospital in Pagosa Springs, CO to San Juan
  Regional Medical Center in Farmington, NM. Since my initial operation
  on May 15th, she has had 9 operations and will have at least 3 more. The first was to clean the wound. The second was a follow-up surgery
  to ensure maximum cleanliness. After a couple of days, the doctor
  noticed a blister that forming on my wound so he preformed another
  operation. This time, to remove the plate and 8 screws that had gotten
  infected. The doctors later found that my bone had started getting
  infected where the hardware was initially placed so they performed
  another surgery to put an antibiotic rod in her bone meant to treat my
  inner bone infection. The last 9 months have been some of the most physically painful days
  I’ve ever had to face to date and I will need additional surgeries to
  get a bone graph and to remove this external fixator that I currently
  have on my right leg. I will have to wear this fixator for 8 more
  months to ensure my leg heals correctly. It has been painful both
  mentally and physically. This would've been my 8th year as a wildland firefighter, which is a
  major source of my primary income. I am and be unemployed until my
  recovery is complete. The monies being raised are to assist my family with gas, food, and
  lodging as they travel three hours each way to and from Dulce, NM to
  Albuquerque, NM for additional appointments as well as surgeries. They
  will also assist myself with bills as I am unable to work during my
  recovery period. I am a member of the Jicarilla Apache Nation and International
  Indigenous Youth Council. I defended the water for several weeks in
  Standing Rock, ND and recently completed a lengthy art project for

380,Enchroma glasses for an aspiring mechanic,U.S. Dollar,"Jul 11, 2018",of $380 goal,6,"WHAT IS ENCHROMA? Over 300 million people worldwide are affected by red-green color
  vision deficiency, also called color blindness. Enchroma has created
  glasses which enhance color vision without the compromise of color accuracy. My name is Joe, I'm ex-military, I'm a student working towards
  being a motorcycle mechanic, and I have color-blindness.  Growing up I
  always had issues with certain colors, purple was a big one.  When I
  joined the Coast Guard they diagnosed me with color vision deficiency
  in my medical screening which severely limited my job selection. 
  While I was enlisted I found many scenarios where I simply could not
  perform a task due to being unable to detect a color; i found out
  ships have red and green colored running lights so you could tell
  their heading at a distance at night, I just thought they were white
  lights.  In my new chosen career field im facing new challenges that
  stem from this issue: in our modern age motorcycles are increasingly
  complex, with more and more wires as more things become controlled by
  onboard computers, all color coded and many with slim 'tracer' lines
  in a different color that are very difficult to see in low light or
  even with flashlights.  If a wiring diagram tells me im looking for a
  certain color wire and i cant pick it out of the mess of wires i cant
  do a repair, which is a very costly delay in a job where any wasted
  time comes right out of your pocket. With a pair of Enchroma glasses I could finally be on a more level
  playing field for a job I've dreamed of having for years, and finally
  have a chance at doing.  Below is some information on Enchroma
  glasses, and I hope that after reading this you'll find it in your
  heart to help me.  Thank you. Enchroma glasses are an optical assistive device; they are not a
  cure for color blindness. Results vary depending on the type and
  extent of color vision deficiency per individual. The glasses are
  estimated to be effective for 4 out of 5 cases (80%) of red-green
  color vision deficiency – prospective users are encouraged to take our
  online color vision test to assess the likelihood of
  efficacy. Enchroma does not endorse use of the glasses to pass
  occupational screening tests such as the Ishihara test. For more
  information please read the FAQs , learn about the Enchroma technology and story , or contact customer support . Check out these reactions",https://fundrazr.com/41M1I0

930,Aidens Cystic Fibrosis Physio Vest,Pound Sterling,,of £10k goal,48,"Aiden aged three has suffered with cystic fibrosis since he was three weeks old and we want to help him as much as we can! We are keen to raise money to purchase a physio vest to loosen the mucas on his lungs and to reduce recurrent chest infections which will improve his quality life. The vest is £7,000 plus insurance which is a huge amount of money. It would be used as an additional method of physiotherapy but would increase his chances of a healthy long life. Cystic Fibrosis (cf) is a life shortening inherited disease, affecting almost 10,000 people in the UK.  It is caused by a faulty gene. The gene controls the movement of salt and water in and out of your cells, so the lungs and digestive system become clogged with mucas, making it hard to breathe and digest food. Although Aiden looks well most of the time, his insides are not. It is not always visible but that does not mean he is ok! There is no cure for CF  and only half of the population in the UK will live past 41. We want Aiden to be one of them! If you can help Aiden and his family please donate to one of the many events we will be organising or online. Any donations will be most appreciated and make a huge difference to a gorgeous boys life. Thank you in advance.",https://fundrazr.com/2UUPb

    Cystic what!? Panic sets in. I’m 42, this can’t be happening. CT Scans, ultrasounds, appointment after appointment, blood tests,

    from Omaha. Cried the entire trip to Southern California sixty years ago. Betty is a mother of four, Grandmother to seven,
    Great-Grandmother to three. Betty is also a sister to two brothers.
    Betty loves her family. To meet Betty is to love Betty. She will
    love you when you don’t deserve it. She will feed you when you are
    full. Betty loves you when nobody else does. Meet Bill , Betty’s brother. Bill was the
    youngest diagnosed case of Alzheimer’s in the US when diagnosed, at
    the age of 48 and succumbed to this disease. Meet Frank ,
    Betty’s other brother, after watching his brother succumb to
    Alzheimer’s, he too fell victim to it. Betty buried her two brothers from this disease. It wasn’t easy.
    The process was financially and emotionally painful. Betty doesn’t
    know she has Alzheimer’s. We don’t tell her. She can’t know. She
    knows its path and it’s destruction. Betty thinks she’s just getting
    forgetful. Betty will never hear that word come out of our mouth.
    She’s seen it enough. She deserves better. To know Betty is to hear her cackle laugh and to eat her amazing
    cookies. Betty hasn’t baked in years. Her cupboards are empty and
    the cookie sheets haven’t seen dough in years. Betty doesn’t
    remember the cookie jar is empty. Oh the cookie jar, the rite of
    passage when entering Betty’s home and the closest route to her
    heart. Betty doesn’t remember how to make cookies. So she colors. 
    With pencils. With abandon. With her heart. A creative outlet never
    known to her prior to Alzheimer’s. It soothes her. It’s the only
    thing that doesn’t frustrate her. It’s not a name or a place. It’s
    not a memory. So she colors. Betty loves her colored pictures and they grace the walls of
    many homes and she is proud of that. Her granddaughters started
    having her sign them and she finds it absolutely hilarious (and
    wonderful) that people want to hang her art in their homes. To
    support the Alzheimer’s Association we are making Betty’s framed
    colorings available for purchase. Each framed coloring is
      $20 (this includes everything, from the frame, to
    shipping). Let a piece of Betty smile upon you daily. We want Betty's Blessings to hang in your home and remind you to
    spend time with your loved ones. When you look at your piece, we
    want it to serve as a reminder to call your own grandmother or
    grandfather, to ask them stories about their childhood, to inquire
    about where they grew up, and to soak in all they have to teach you.
    We want you to call your mom or dad up and ask if all the family
    recipes are recorded, and if they aren't, we want you to start doing
    that. Our memory is a gift that not all are blessed to maintain, so
    while it's there, appreciate it. As our mother, our grandmother, our
    wife, Betty has blessed us for so many years with her love, her
    cooking, her ""happy birthday"" messages and her
    way-to-early-Christmas shopping. If Betty's Blessings can make even
    a small impact on families outside of our own, we know she will be
    happy, even in spite of this terrible disease. Plus, she's been
    begging us to ""get a job"" every day for a while now, and
    this will give her one! To order, please donate through this platform and there will be

"6,138",Zach Branson's Medical Fundraiser,U.S. Dollar,,of $15k goal,44,"Zachary Branson was born with a liver disease known as biliary
  atresia. The main procedure that was performed is known as a Kasai
  portoenterostomy. This operation connects the bile drainage from the
  liver directly to the intestinal tract. Success of this procedure may
  be improved when it is done before an infant is 8 weeks old. The Kasai
  procedure is helpful because it permits bile to flow and can allow a
  child to grow and remain in fairly good health for many years. It is
  important to understand that this surgery is typically a treatment for
  and not cure of biliary atresia. Ongoing liver disease is likely to
  continue to occur even with a successful operation. Up to 80 percent
  of children who undergo the Kasai portoenterostomy will eventually
  need to have a liver transplant. Doctors warned that Zach would not
  live past the age of 2 years old. Now at 30 years old, Zach has
  surprised the medical community. He has gone through quite rough times
  in his life growing up with this disease. His mother passed away in
  2006 from liver and kidney failure due to alcoholism. Zach cannot work

  feeling like “home,” like “It’s so good to see you again after all
  these years! I do so adore you!” That’s how I felt about Col the first time I saw her photo and
  read a comment she had posted online in a business-oriented group
  years ago. Since then, I’ve gotten to know Col “better,” and I still have
  that same feeling. She’s like a cross between an angel, a friend and a sister! We have amazing conversations in which we both let go of all
  kinds of “stuff” that no longer serves us and we experience huge AHA moments! If you had asked me a year or so ago how I felt about Col, I
  would have told you that she’s a dear, dear friend, at the very least. And yet, as close as we had gotten on so many levels, I
  had NO idea that Col was often in severe physical pain. Not only does she not complain about pain, she’s so genuinely
  joyful and inspired and inspiring, it never dawned on me that she
  could be anything but energetic and “healthy.” Her very being exudes well-being! Col wrote a beautiful blog post that illustrates her approach to
  life and living, even in the midst of pain... even in the midst of
  illness. Please take a couple minutes to be inspired by the beauty of
  Col’s approach to — and dance with — life: Dancing in the Rain . Throughout the pain and the illness, Col has been giving to
  others in the most magnificent way. She created a FREE program called Magical Medical Mystery Tour , in which she
  interviewed amazing healers of all kinds. She created a forum in which
  these experts shared their wisdom freely with anyone who cared to
  participate. The gift of these interviews continues to unfold within
  me and, I’m sure, within all who were game for the adventure. So when Col told me that she now has one or two Western medical
  doctors for EACH of her organs! —and as much as she loves and
  appreciates them, Western medicine doesn’t seem to be working for her
  particular illness — I didn’t have to ask if she had tried natural and
  alternative healing modalities. I knew she had — with joy and
  enthusiasm and insight ... And yet, her body still has more to say — more insights to
  reveal — and it wants to reveal those insights and that wisdom through
  biological medicine. Col has received many “nudges” from the universe
  pointing her in that direction — and this is a woman who KNOWS how to
  listen to and dance with the universe. Like all great dances, it’s a two-way experience. There is
  giving and receiving. And there is constant expansion. One of the most obvious — and magnificent — benefits of this
  expansive dance with the universe and with pain and illness has been
  creativity. Everything that Col learns and experiences goes deep
  within her being and comes out as ART! Art with spirit. Art with soul. Art with purpose. And art that
  is infused with the energy of healing and a return to balance and wholeness! If you feel inspired, I encourage you to listen to your soul.
  Listen to your body. Listen to your inner response to Col’s artwork.
  And if something resonates deeply within you, please purchase it. Not only will you be bringing something beautiful and powerful
  into your own home or office, you will be helping to make Col’s dream
  come true, the universe-directed dream to receive biological treatment. I know I will be buying several pieces of Col’s work for myself
  and to give as gifts. And I know I will not be alone. Col is so loved
  by so many! Sue Elliott Founder/Editor-in-Chief of Law of Attraction Magazine www.LovingMyself.com ..................................................

884,Help Nadia pay for gender affirming surgeries,Euro,"Aug 12, 2018",of €4k goal,18,"Hi there. My name is Nadia . I'm a neurodiverse
  transgender woman of color living The Netherlands. I was assigned male at birth, but for most of my life, especially
  since I started puberty I've been suffering from crippling dysphoria regarding my gender. Along with my ADHD , this led to me developing chronic
    depression, anxiety and agoraphobia in my late teens and
  young adulthood. Eventually I couldn't take it any more and realized
  that the only way I could ever be truly happy is to transition and start living as my most authentic self. I’ve lived in this body for 31 years, of which only the last 3 I've
  been on Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) . This,
  along with things like permanent laser facial hair
  removal has gone a long way towards helping me look and feel
  like the woman I know I am. But there's only so much that hormones can
  do. It can't fix the parts of my body that cause me the most
  dysphoria. Only surgery can change those. When I first started transition, I didnt want to rush into any
  surgeries. After all, they're scary, permanent, invasive and very
  expensive. I was hoping HRT alone would be enough. But over the past 3
  years the pain I feel regarding these specific aspects of my body has
  been constant and persistent regardless of how much
  self love I try to practice. It’s not something that’s just
    going to go away on its own. Deciding on getting these procedures isn't a decision I made lightly.
  It came after years of deliberation and trying everything else I could
  think of to make this feeling go away. Over the past 9 months especially, my mental health has gone down the
  drain. A lot of the time I'm too scared to go outside by myself,
  because how transphobic society can be to someone like me. My loved
  ones, family members, and partners have noticed how much worse I've
  gotten. I've been feeling hopeless, gross and most of all stuck. Like
  I'm unable to move forward in any way. Just like my decision to come out and transition, the decision to get
  rid of my facial hair using laser hair removal, the decision to go on
  HRT, having these surgeries really is the best
  option. It’s the next step I need to take in my transition. Please consider donating if you’re able to. It would mean
      the world to me and you’d be helping me out in a big way. If
      you’re unable to donate please share the link as much as possible. Thank you. <3",https://fundrazr.com/helpnadia
"2,200",URGENTLY NEEDED New Hips for Christian McCudden!!,Australian Dollar,"Aug 4, 2018",of $81k goal,6,"Hi, my wife and I have been friends with Christian and Melissa for nearly
    twenty years... it has been many years since we have caught up with
    this wonderful family and after a recent phone conversation with
    Christian we have only just now learned of the ongoing physical
    hardship he has been going through over the years and the very
    difficult decision he has just had to make..... After our chat I thought there has to be something we can do to
    help, so I have setup this campaign in the hope that you will all
    join us in standing together to make a massive difference to
    Christian’s upcoming journey! Following is a snapshot of the McCudden family and Christian’s
    journey so far and the reasons why our donations are so very vital
    and impactful at this time for them... Christian has been married to Melissa for 21 yrs. and they have
    3 three amazing children, Noah, Ella and Zachary. In 2013 Christian & Melissa moved from their home in
    Sydney's northern beaches leaving family, friends and working at C3
    Oxford falls as one of the full time pastors, and planted C3 church
    Noosa, launching in May of 2013. Prior to planting C3 Noosa they were a part of C3 Oxford falls
    for 20 years. Over that time Christian fulfilled many roles in various
  areas including: Youth ministry for 12yrs / Pastoring / Lecturing in the Bible College. Travelled with and assisted Ps Phil for 6 years. Project managed the buildings and renovations that went on over the
  years at C3 Oxford falls. Christian has also over many years ministered in Church's throughout
  Australia, New Zealand, America, Europe, Asia and Indonesia seeing
  many people saved, healed and touched by the power of God. He has also seen over the year’s incredible healings and testimonies. Blind eyes opened / Deaf ears opened / Cancer healed Crippled people getting out of wheel chairs / Stroke patients healed
  and walking and speaking. Pain leaving bodies immediately / Blood conditions healed / People
  who were suicidal set free Dead raised to life / Arthritis conditions healed Broken bones healed instantly… and many more stories to be told. Christian and Melissa have now been on the Sunshine Coast QLD for 5
  1/2 years with C3 Noosa just celebrating its 5th birthday.  A church
  that is vibrant, growing, and impacting many lives in their local
  community and beyond. As this all still continues to grow and function
  Christian currently works part time for their church C3 Noosa and full
  time as a carpenter, building on job sites. Over the past 8 years Christian has
    suffered with pain in his body from a gradual degenerative arthritic
    condition in both his hips. In the past 4 years the pain has become
    very intense with major side effects such as only being able to
    sleep a couple of sound hours a night, having limited movement,
    unable to exercise or do the physical things he loves to do and
    especially with his kids. Two years ago Christian had the
    opportunity to go over to the U.S to get stem cell treatment in both
    hips which has helped to a small degree but has not been able to see
    the full benefits due to his current working activity of being on
    the tools building. Building over the last few years
      has taken a huge toll on his body and made the pain more intense.
      Christian has now come to a place where he cannot physically
      continue to do his work labouring as a builder, due to the extreme
      pain and limited movement. He has no other option left other than to proceed with
      further treatment being a double hip replacement! A double hip replacement and the extensive rehabilitation
        involved is quite costly and the road to full recovery is a good
        6 to12 months! In a matter of days Christian will have no income from building as he has had to give notice and quit due to his bodies inability
    to function sufficiently in the way needed to perform his role as a
    builder and his bodies pain levels have reached a crippling level. Christian needs our help NOW! The results from this will be amazing! It will give Christian back his quality of life! It will give
      him back the things that we take for granted like having a full
      night’s sleep, having no crippling pain, being able to exercise,
      and the ability to do normal life activities with his children
      while they are still young! We would love to enable Christian to get this surgery done ASAP
      and for him to have the appropriate time required for a full recovery. It is a costly procedure and the post-operative rehabilitation
      expenses required will be quite high. To enable Christian to have the procedure and the necessary
        time off not needing to labour physically in the building
        industry is a minimum of six months..... So that’s what we have
        based the amount of funds needed to raise on: - The double hip
        replacement surgery, rehabilitation and physical therapy for six
        months and funds to keep the family afloat while Christian is
        unable to work. So we kindly ask you to consider donating to help bless
        Christian and his family at this time as they make plans towards
        treatment, surgery and rehabilitation. Christian has been such a faithful servant and blessing to so
      many lives over the years. A servant’s heart through and through
      and one of the most generous people you will ever meet. If you are reading this then you have probably been blessed in
        some form either directly or indirectly from the big hearted
        kindness of this faithful man. We now we get the opportunity to sow back into this rich soil of
    an amazing family and help them in their time of need! They are so humble and never complain most people wouldn’t even
      know about this ongoing struggle over the years and how Christian
      has been enduring such pain in his body while going about blessing others! Let’s all band together to quickly raise the funds for this
        much needed surgery! If we all dig deep, give what we can and pass this on to our
        various friends and networks then Christian will be on the road
        to recovery before we know it... Thank you all for your thoughts, prayers and generous donations.... God Bless!!",https://fundrazr.com/f1MWCb
"2,610",Art Fundraiser To Support Sookie & Jake's Recovery,Canadian Dollar,,of $2.5k goal,38,"As many of you know, Sookie and Jake are the loves of my life.
  They've softened my grumpy guarded heart, taught me how to love and
  have a little more trust in this world. They will both be spending
  this summer in recovery and I am trying to raise some funds to support
  the cost during this time. Sookie had a surgery on her left knee a few years back and has never
  fully recovered. She continues to experience mobility issues, pain and
  can no longer be by my side day to day. In addition my partner Jake
  will be undergoing surgery this summer and will be in recovery for 2
  months.  The surgery will be happening in the US and all medical
  supplies will be paid for out of pocket. ALL funds raised will directly support: Ongoing vet bills
  (x-ray/tests/treatment), medication and supplements, as well as
  medical supplies for surgery. I don’t feel comfortable asking for help without providing something
  in return so I’ve added lots of “perks” as this website calls them. I
  am an artist so please take this opportunity to get some prints and
  shirts from me. WHY HYENAS? Hyenas are perhaps one of the coolest queerest animals and you should
  celebrate them. ""Hyena energy"" is something I have coined to
  describe a type of connection that I have with others. It is a dark,
  queer, mischievous and rebellious energy. An energy that is seductive,
  chaotic, vicious, a little destructive but ultimately spontaneous,
  indulgent, compelling and dangerous. It is important to acknowledge
  that hyenas are recognized as magical, powerful animals in various
  cultures and traditions around the world. If Jake and I were an animal we would be a hyena. When we met Sookie
  she looked and acted like our little hyena from day one and continues
  to be the perfect addition to our pack. To help raise funds to support both of my little hyenas, I've created
  hyena t-shirts and prints. My dear friend Eli Howey (""Uncle
  Eli"" to Sookie ""My Other Boyfriend"" to Jake) has
  generously donated 31 prints for this fundraiser. Kiana (a.k.a.,
  KRIVVY our “Foster Child” and “Sister” to Sookie) has donated 20
  special edition art packs with 7 one-of-a-kind, handmade and protected
  stickers, 2 magnets and one 2 x 3 original signed drawings per pack.
  I'd like to thank Roya DelSol for donating her time and talent by
  taking photos of the prints and t-shirts. Please support my little hyena family. ❤ NOTE For those in Toronto we will be able to deliver prints and t-shirts
  or arrange for pick up at the Margin of Eras Gallery in Parkdale (1684
  Queen Street West, closest major intersection is Roncesvalles and
  Queen). Shipping is included in the base cost of the perk locally. Any
  purchase of a print or t-shirt that isn't local will be $10 extra.",https://fundrazr.com/hyenafamily
"11,865",Help Geoffrey Walk Again,U.S. Dollar,"Sep 1, 2018",of $25k goal,49,"Hi, My name is Sarah and I'm trying to raise money to help my big
  brother, Geoffrey. My entire life, Geoffrey has been an amazing athlete; he's someone
  who could out run, out climb and out catch anyone. My first memory is
  sitting on the bleachers when I was three watching his baseball games;
  to be honest I mostly liked going for the hot dogs, but I still
  remember watching him run around the bases in a flash of white, blue
  and dust. As I grew up, Geoffrey was someone I always looked up to -- he was
  the amazing skateboarding ninja, a rock climber, adventurer, surfer,
  accomplished chef and snowboarder. When I was 13, he was living and
  snowboarding full time in Salt Lake City, Utah. One of my happiest
  memories was watching him win a snowboarding competition - long before
  snowboarding was an Olympic sport. He was a natural on the snow, able
  to move across, around and over it like a bird gliding over the currents. Now, Geoffrey has trouble walking. He's developed avascular necrosis
  - or bone death - in both of his ankles. I didn't know what that meant
  either when he first told me. What it does mean is that he's in
  constant pain  and has trouble walking.  I do know that it's very rare
  to develop this in the ankles, especially in people as young as he is,
  and that it's very difficult to fix. After seeing many doctors and specialists over the past two years,
  he's finally going to be able to have surgery at the  San Francisco
  Orthopedic Surgery Center in July. They've told him he'll have to have
   arthroscopic surgery on each ankle -- which means going into the
  joint and scraping away the damage and fixing the bone, ligament and
  cartilage as they go along. In some ways Geoffrey is lucky; if the
  surgery goes well, then he'll be able to walk again without having to
  have his ankle joints replaced. To make this happen my mom, Elizabeth Worley, and Geoffrey have been
  looking for a way to make sure Geoffery can get the surgery and
  support he needs to walk again. His insurance will cover most of the
  surgery cost itself, but he'll need to have intensive rehab and
  physical therapy to help him heal and be able to walk again -- and it
  could take between six and eight months for both ankles to heal.  And
  this is where we need your help. For an additional $25,000, we can cover everything his insurance
  won't and make sure he has the support he needs to heal. This mean
  Geoffrey will be able to walk again, be able to work again, and, while
  his snowboarding days are behind him, with your help he'll be able to
  keep up with his amazing dog, Max.",https://fundrazr.com/11Md51

"4,003",Hannah's Heroes,U.S. Dollar,,of $177k goal,88,"Our daughter Hannah was born with 2 very rare diseases 1 called C.A.H
  and the other called Spinal Muscular Atrophy, which works to rob her
  of her ability to move, breath and, eventually, live. There is a drug
  that can stop this disease. It has just approved it. But accessing it
  costs $177,000, and the process of our drug plan won’t be ready for
  another year. That’s a year that our little girl can’t afford to wait.
  It would be a year of vulnerability and loss. But with your
  help, we believe we can turn it into a year of miracles! Let me
  tell you the rest of our story. Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) has
  become our daily life. It’s the genetic condition most likely to kill
  children under six years of age, and our daughter has it. It’s a
  progressive lower motor neuron disease, that is loosely paralleled to
  adult ALS. But there are significant differences: most notably, SMA
  never affects cognition, so our daughter is as bright and keen as any
  other child her age. At 14 months, Hannah took her first 3 steps. She has never walked
  since then. After those first steps, she lost any strength to walk,
  then strength to pull up to stand, and then the strength to crawl. She
  can barely get from a lying position to a sitting position. Hannah is
  our mature little scholar! But she is completely dependant on us for
  dressing, toileting, and getting her in her wheelchair.But those
  things aren’t the worst. She is at an extreme risk of respiratory
  failure. Every single simple cold/viral infection is a threat. At
  least three times a year these infections strike hard enough to send
  her to the hospital. As a parent, I weep and get nauseous just
  thinking about this. I don’t want to think about what the next year
  could hold for her. But the amazing thing is that it doesn’t have
  to be that kind of year for our little girl. For over two decades
  the gene responsible for SMA has been known but there has not been a
  single available treatment. This past summer the first drug in history
  to specifically treat SMA was approved ! It is called Spinraza
  (Nusinersen). It can completely halt SMA in its path and even lead to
  some GAIN in muscle strength! This drug truly is a miracle, and
  we need our daughter on it as soon as possible. Though it’s
  approved Spinraza won’t be available on our drug plans for another
  year. It costs $177,000 to provide a year’s supply for Hannah 3 vials
  . The manufacturer, Biogen, will sell it directly to families willing
  to pay for it. This treatment WILL stop Hannah's respiratory deterioration, keep her
  hands strong, and prevent future problems in her spine that would
  require surgery.And we don’t even know what gains it might provide.
  Instead of a year of atrophy it can become a year of miracles! But we
  need your help. We do everything we can for our little girl but we
  can’t do this alone. We need to raise $177,000. Please join us
  on our journey and help to make this a year of miracles for Hannah",https://fundrazr.com/HannahsHeroes
"581,557",British Gut,,,,,"This is a unique open collaboration between the TwinsUK team at King's College London and The
      American Gut Project (AGP) to try to understand the bacterial
    diversity of the British Gut . Many people don't realize that the bacteria that live inside us play
  an incredibly important role in our health. There are so many of them,
  that they make up 90 percent of the cells in our body and their most
  important jobs include manufacturing vitamins for us and breaking down
  and digesting our food. The trillions of bacteria in our gut weigh
  nearly 2 kg (over 4lbs). This community of bacteria can be thought of
  as an extra 'organ' which we call our ""microbiome"". We
  evolved together with our microbiome over millions of years. Recent
  research has discovered that small changes in this finely balanced
  community can affect our immune system, metabolism, body weight, mood
  and may even cause diseases such as Crohn's disease, irritable bowel
  syndrome, cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes and heart disease. This is the first project of its kind in Europe and, with your help,
  we will be able to discover more about the crucial relationship
  between our health and our microbiome, and on a personal level, you
  will be able to discover the bacterial profile of your own gut. With
  your help, we hope to be able to answer questions such as 'How much
  does our choice of lifestyle and diet influence our microbiome, and
  can we alter our microbiome to make us healthier?' We are discovering that each person is very different and has their
  own unique microbiome. More research is needed to work out what
  constitutes a 'healthy' microbiome, and which combinations of bacteria
  should try and be avoided. In order to do this ambitious and
  much-needed project, we urgently need a large scale collection of
  human samples. Over 7 thousand people have already signed up in
  America already- but we need many more from UK Europe. The project mainly focuses on the gut as this is our main 'microbial
  home', however, the study will also look at oral, skin and (for women)
  vaginal communities as these areas of the body have problems such as
  tooth decay, gum disease, acne and infertility and may be influenced
  by the microbiome. What does it entail? First you need to sign up (see Perks on the right) and select your
  level of contribution to the project. Within three weeks, you will
  receive a kit in the mail together with detailed instructions on how
  to proceed. Shipping within the UK first class should be around £2.90,
  but we recommend taking the sample to the post office to get the
  proper postage. Getting the postage right on the first try is
  important since samples that spend a long time in transit will likely
  not produce the highest quality results. After you have returned your sample to us, the samples will be
  processed and analysed by the Knight Lab at University of California,
  San Diego and you will be provided with a list of the major groups of
  bacteria in your sample and the proportions in which they are found.
  We estimate that this will take around 3 months from the time your
  sample is scanned into our lab (but possibly longer) and once we
  provide you with your results, you will be able to see how your
  bacterial community compares to others in the study. From the diet and
  lifestyle information that you provide, we will also be able to show
  you how your results compare to other people who are within the same
  diet and lifestyle group as you (but having a very different result to
  them does not necessarily mean anything bad, it can just be that you
  have experienced slight lifestyle differences that mean that your
  bacterial profile is different). Please note that this is a scientific study, not a clinical or
      commercial project, and we will not be able to provide you with
      any clinical information/advice related to your microbiome profile. How will my sample be used? The British Gut project, like the American model, gives participants
  the opportunity to compare their personal microbiome profiles to
  family members, and other people both in the UK and abroad. Our
  project is based on the principles of 'access to all'. The data
  collected from the sample you provide will be shared anonymously both
  with participants and scientists, allowing many different scientific
  hypotheses and questions to be answered using your valuable sample. We look forward to working together on this new and exciting project.
